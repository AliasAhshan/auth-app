## Email Workflow

- Email verification and password reset flows are handled using **Mailtrap**, which safely captures outbound emails in development.
- Token-based verification is used for secure one-time actions via URL.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Axios, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Email Service**: Mailtrap (development only)

## Notes

- The **profile page** is styled but intentionally minimal â€” it's ready for expansion (e.g., avatar, settings, user data).
- Animations are handled using Tailwindâ€™s `animate` classes with delays.
- All forms include real-time validation and UI feedback.
