## Authentication Application

This is a Full-Stack Next.js application that serves as an Authentication App.

This application is setup with MongoDB and consists of the following pages: home, signup, login, verifyemail, forgotpassword, resetpassword, and profile.

All of these routes are fully functional and designed with the exception of the profile page that lacks depth and only serves as a canvas.

The verifying of email and resetting password is done through Mailtrap.
